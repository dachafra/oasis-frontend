## About
Together, Ghent and the region of Madrid have initiated an innovative action that will increase the accessibility of public services and public transport. To do this, they collaborate to publish linked open data. Both cities are experienced publishers of open data, and together they prove that new technologies (such as the “Semantic Web”) can lead to economies of scale, such as the creation of cross-country applications.  

[Team OASIS](https://oasis.team/) has build a proof of concept webapp that shows the **quality of experience** score or [tripscore](http://tripscore.eu) of trips on a certain day within a timespan of two hours. The score itself is based on your personal preferences such as maximum acceptable delay or maximum acceptable amount of hops. Travellers can now make an informed decision on when and which train, tram or bus to take.

The applications uses linked open data in the form of [Linked Connections](http://linkedconnections.org/) which uses both static and historical data.
